          custom_instructions: |
            Read CLAUDE.md for full project context before doing anything.
            Always create a branch named claude/issue-{number}-{short-description}.
            Always run tests before creating a PR: PYTHONPATH="$PWD" .venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v
            Set up the venv first if needed: python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements_test.txt
            Do NOT implement WH77 support - it is a testing sensor only.
            Do NOT auto-merge PRs - create the PR and leave it for review.
