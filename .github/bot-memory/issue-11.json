I can see you\\'re experiencing sensor mapping issues with your GW2000A + WH69 setup where entities aren\\'t being created properly, and some sensors are showing as unnamed (like \"3\" and \"5\").\\n\\nLet me analyze your data:\\n\\n## Issue Analysis\\n\\nLooking at your `get_live_data_info`, I can see the problem. Your WH69 sensor (ID \"77\") is providing data with **numeric string keys** (\"3\", \"5\") and ...'}",
    "{'timestamp': '2025-09-16T09:12:13.796449', 'analysis': \"\ud83e\udd16 **Ecowitt Local Bot Analysis - Continuing**\\n\\nExcellent suggestion about adding diagnostic data support! That would definitely make troubleshooting much easier. I'll add that as an enhancement to consider.\\n\\n## Current Status Analysis\\n\\nBased on your updated information, I can see the core issue now. Your WH69 is providing data with hex IDs in the `common_list` section, but the current sensor mapping logic has a critical flaw in how it handles WH69 sensors.\\n\\nLooking at your data:\\n- **Missing enti...\"}"
