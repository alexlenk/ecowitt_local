# ü§ñ **Official Claude Code Bot Test Plan**

## **Overview**

This document defines the comprehensive testing strategy for validating the official Claude Code GitHub Actions implementation. The test validates that the bot can handle real-world device support requests following our documented patterns and architecture.

---

## **üéØ Test Scenario: WH77 Multi-Sensor Station Support**

### **Test Description**
Simulate a realistic user request for adding support for a fictional "WH77 Multi-Sensor Station" that exhibits the same patterns as our successfully resolved WH90 issue (device type string mismatch).

### **Why WH77 Test is Perfect**
- **Realistic**: Based on actual WH90 pattern we've solved
- **Safe**: Fictional device won't impact real users
- **Comprehensive**: Tests all our learned patterns
- **Measurable**: Clear pass/fail criteria
- **Repeatable**: Can be run multiple times

---

## **üìã Test Setup Requirements**

### **Test Fixtures** 
Create realistic test data in `tests/fixtures/test_wh77.py`:

```python
"""Test fixtures for WH77 Multi-Sensor Station testing."""

WH77_SENSOR_MAPPING = {
    "id": "C234", 
    "img": "wh77",
    "name": "Multi-Sensor Station",  # Key: Different from device img
    "type": "52",
    "batt": "3", 
    "signal": "-65"
}

WH77_LIVE_DATA = {
    "common_list": [
        {"id": "C234", "val": "23.5", "ch": "0x02"},  # Temperature
        {"id": "C234", "val": "65", "ch": "0x07"},    # Humidity
        {"id": "C234", "val": "12.5", "ch": "0x0B"},  # Wind Speed
        {"id": "C234", "val": "8.2", "ch": "0x0C"},   # Wind Gust
        {"id": "C234", "val": "180", "ch": "0x0A"},   # Wind Direction
        {"id": "C234", "val": "450", "ch": "0x15"},   # Solar Radiation
        {"id": "C234", "val": "5", "ch": "0x17"},     # UV Index
    ]
}

WH77_BATTERY_MAPPING = {
    "wh77batt": {
        "name": "WH77 Multi-Sensor Station Battery",
        "sensor_key": "0x02"
    }
}
```

### **Validation Test Case**
Create test in `tests/test_wh77_support.py`:

```python
"""Test case for WH77 Multi-Sensor Station support."""

def test_wh77_sensor_mapping():
    """Test that WH77 follows the correct architectural pattern."""
    # Test that device type "Multi-Sensor Station" maps to hex IDs
    # Test that existing hex ID definitions are reused
    # Test that no duplicate definitions are created
    pass

def test_wh77_entities_created():
    """Test that WH77 creates expected entities.""" 
    # Test temperature, humidity, wind, solar, UV, battery entities
    # Test consistent entity naming with existing devices
    pass
```

## **üéØ GitHub Issue Template**

### **Issue Title**: `WH77 Multi-Sensor Station not creating entities`

### **Issue Body**:
```markdown
## WH77 Multi-Sensor Station Not Creating Entities

**Hardware Setup:**
- Gateway: GW2000A  
- Sensor: WH77 Multi-Sensor Station
- Hardware ID: C234
- Firmware: Latest

**Problem:**
The WH77 sensor is detected by the integration and shows as a device, but **creates zero entities**. The device appears in Home Assistant as "Multi-Sensor Station" but has no temperature, humidity, wind, or battery sensors.

**Current Behavior:**
- ‚úÖ Device detected (shows as "Multi-Sensor Station") 
- ‚ùå No entities created (0 entities)
- ‚ùå No sensors appear in entity list

**Expected Behavior:**
Should create entities for temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation, UV index, and battery status, similar to other weather stations like WH69 and WH90.

**Diagnostic Data:**

<details>
<summary>Sensor Mapping JSON</summary>

```json
{
  "id": "C234",
  "img": "wh77", 
  "name": "Multi-Sensor Station",
  "type": "52",
  "batt": "3",
  "signal": "-65"
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Live Data JSON</summary>

```json
{
  "common_list": [
    {"id": "C234", "val": "23.5", "ch": "0x02"},
    {"id": "C234", "val": "65", "ch": "0x07"},
    {"id": "C234", "val": "12.5", "ch": "0x0B"},
    {"id": "C234", "val": "8.2", "ch": "0x0C"},
    {"id": "C234", "val": "180", "ch": "0x0A"},
    {"id": "C234", "val": "450", "ch": "0x15"},
    {"id": "C234", "val": "5", "ch": "0x17"}
  ]
}
```
</details>

**Version:** v1.4.9
**Home Assistant:** 2024.12.x

This looks very similar to the WH90 issue that was recently fixed. The device type string seems to be "Multi-Sensor Station" instead of "wh77".

@claude Can you help implement support for the WH77 Multi-Sensor Station?

## **‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria**

### **Primary Success Criteria**

#### **1. Pattern Recognition** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Bot identifies this as device type string mismatch pattern
- [ ] Bot references similar WH90 fix (v1.4.8) 
- [ ] Bot understands root cause is sensor_mapper.py device type detection

#### **2. Architectural Compliance** ‚úÖ  
- [ ] Bot proposes single-line addition to `sensor_mapper.py`
- [ ] Bot extends existing `elif` condition (doesn't create new one)
- [ ] Bot reuses existing hex ID system entirely
- [ ] Bot mentions using existing battery mapping system

#### **3. Anti-Pattern Avoidance** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Bot does NOT propose creating new hex ID definitions in `const.py`
- [ ] Bot does NOT propose device-specific sensor mappings
- [ ] Bot does NOT modify existing WH69/WS90/WH90 conditions
- [ ] Bot does NOT create inconsistent entity naming

#### **4. Implementation Quality** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Proposed code change is minimal (1 line addition)
- [ ] Code follows exact pattern: `or "multi-sensor station" in sensor_type.lower()`
- [ ] Solution reuses existing hex ID definitions (lines 276-350 in const.py)
- [ ] Maintains consistent entity naming with other devices

#### **5. Testing & Validation** ‚úÖ
- [ ] Bot mentions running test suite requirement
- [ ] Bot verifies compatibility with existing devices  
- [ ] Bot ensures no regressions in WH69/WS90/WH90 functionality
- [ ] Bot validates against architectural principles

### **Code Quality Requirements**

#### **Expected Implementation**:
```python
# In custom_components/ecowitt_local/sensor_mapper.py
elif sensor_type.lower() in ("wh77", "weather_station_wh77") or "multi-sensor station" in sensor_type.lower():
    # WH77 Multi-Sensor Station (similar to WH69/WS90/WH90, uses hex IDs in common_list)
    keys.extend([
        "0x02",  # Temperature
        "0x03",  # Temperature (alternate)
        "0x07",  # Humidity
        "0x0B",  # Wind speed
        "0x0C",  # Wind gust
        "0x19",  # Max daily gust
        "0x0A",  # Wind direction
        "0x6D",  # Wind direction 10min avg
        "0x15",  # Solar radiation
        "0x17",  # UV index
        "wh77batt",  # Battery level
    ])
```

#### **Battery Mapping Addition** (if proposed):
```python
# In custom_components/ecowitt_local/const.py (battery sensors section)
"wh77batt": {
    "name": "WH77 Multi-Sensor Station Battery", 
    "sensor_key": "0x02"
},
```

### **Failure Criteria (Auto-Fail)**

#### **Immediate Failures** ‚ùå
- Bot creates duplicate hex ID definitions (e.g., new "0x02" definition)
- Bot modifies existing device type conditions  
- Bot proposes device-specific const.py sensor definitions
- Bot suggests breaking changes to existing architecture
- Bot creates inconsistent entity naming patterns

#### **Architecture Violations** ‚ùå 
- Large multi-file changes instead of minimal addition
- New architecture patterns instead of extending existing ones
- Complex solutions when simple one-line fix is correct
- Testing requirements not mentioned or followed
